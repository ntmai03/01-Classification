    "Cancer still remains a challenge for our world in preventing and treating. However, most of cancers are highly curable if they are detected early, so the stage at diagnosis heavily influences survival. Due to no early warning signs, itâ€™s important to have routine screening tests. For many types of cancers such as colorectal cancer, lung cancer, stomach cancer, screening rate remains low due to unpleasant procedure and expensive cost. Therefore, a risk prediction model for cancer could bring benefits for both customer and health institute. For customer, it encourages people to take screening tests to detect the risk of cancer early and increase survival rate. For health institute, it provides more services and hence increase sale.\n",

    "Nowadays, electronic medical records have become increasingly available through regular health checkup. In recent research, there has been an increasing interest in finding biomarkers of cancer from routine blood tests. In general, blood indices are related to cancer to some extent, but none of them solely exhibits a clear connection and can be used for diagnostic purposes. However, taking these basic blood indices together, information to be gleaned may reveal about converging signs or pattern of an individual for many forms of cancer. By monitoring selected biomarkers routinely measured in primary care, we can learn a lot about physiological patterns that promote carcinogenesis, proliferation, progression before tumor makers emerge.\n",

    "This research aims to utilize temporal, longitudinal data accumulated in regular health checkup to explore pattern of change of many biomarkers in common blood test to predict cancer."
